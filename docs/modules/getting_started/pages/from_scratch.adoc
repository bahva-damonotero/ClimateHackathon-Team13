= Creating a New Project

== Prerequisites

Things you will need:

* https://git-scm.com/[Git]
* https://nodejs.org/en/[Node]
* https://www.npmjs.com/[NPM] (installed with Node)
* GitHub Personal Access Token
* Code editor or IDE

Technologies you should be familiar with:

* https://reactjs.org/[React]

Please read the information about `.npmrc` files found xref:overview::npmrc.adoc[here] before proceeding.

== Instructions

=== Step 1: Install https://yeoman.io/[Yeoman]

Run the following command to install Yeoman globally:

[source,bash]
----
npm install -g yo
----

NOTE: You may need to prefix the above command with `sudo` to get it to work, but you should try without it first.

=== Step 2: Clone the React Scaffold Repo

Clone the https://github.boozallencsn.com/uip/sample-scaffold-react[sample-scaffold-react] repo using Git:

[source,bash]
----
git clone git@github.boozallencsn.com:uip/sample-scaffold-react.git
----

=== Step 3: Install the Generator

From **inside the scaffold repo's root directory**, run the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
npm ci
npm link
----

=== Step 4: Run the Generator

From any directory **outside of the scaffold repo's directory**, run:

[source,bash]
----
yo ui-react
----

Follow the instructions in the terminal.

=== Troubleshooting

* If you receive a **404** error from NPM when running the generator, double check that your PAT is valid and has the correct permissions, then re-run the generator.

* If you encounter an `UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY` error, run the following command (before re-running the generator):
+
[source,bash]
----
npm set strict-ssl false
----

== IDE Configuration

For `.editorconfig` to have an effect, check if your IDE requires a plugin/extension.

A list of IDEs that do not require a plugin can be found https://editorconfig.org/#pre-installed[here].

A list of IDEs that require a plugin can be found https://editorconfig.org/#download[here].

== Integration with Prettier

To enable Prettier, `.eslintrc.js` will need to be modified. The `prettier/prettier` rule has been added and is turned off by default. To turn on Prettier, change `"prettier/prettier": "off"` to `"prettier/prettier": "warn"` in the rules object.

== Proxying API Requests in Development

People often serve the front-end React app from the same host and port as their backend implementation.

* To tell the development server to proxy any unknown requests to your API server in development, add a proxy field to your `package.json`, for example: `"proxy"`: `"http://localhost:8080/"`.
* This way, when you fetch `('/api/todos')` in development, the development server will recognize that itâ€™s not a static asset, and will proxy your request to `http://localhost:8080/api/todos` as a fallback. The development server will only attempt to send requests without text/html in its Accept header to the proxy.
* The Proxy option supports HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket connections.
* If the Proxy option is not flexible enough for you, alternatively you can: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development/#configuring-the-proxy-manually[Configure the Proxy Manually]
* This is how we chose to do it (see `src/setupProxy.js`) at `"port"`: `8080`, because it allows us more flexibility.
* Otherwise, we could have enabled CORS on our server https://enable-cors.org/server_expressjs.html[via Express].
* Lastly, we could have used https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables[environment variables] to inject the right server host and port into your app.

== Deploying Using Docker

The sample Dockerfile uses Nginx server to run the application. Provided is the most basic configuration needed to build docker image.

=== Prerequisites

* https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[Docker] installed
* Project created using `yo uip-react`
* Connected to F5 VPN

=== Setup

. Ensure Docker is running and you are connected to the VPN
. Build the container in the root directory of the generated project (the app you created using `yo uip-react`, not the root directory of the scaffold repo)
+
[source,bash]
----
npm run docker-build
----
** Update `docker/build-docker` and `docker/serve-docker` with your `appName` and `authToken` where `appName` is the desired name of your image and `authToken` is the token generated from Nexus.
. Run the container:
+
[source,bash]
+
----
npm run docker-serve
----
. View the running app:
+
[source,bash]
----
open http://localhost:8888/
----
